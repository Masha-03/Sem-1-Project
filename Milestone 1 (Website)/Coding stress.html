<h2>Suggestions on how 'Computer and Network Security'should evolve</h2>
<body>
    <p><strong>AI and Machine Learning:</strong><br>
        + AI can analyze large amounts of data quickly and identify unusual patterns or 
          actions that could mean a security breach<br>
        + Leading to faster detection<br>
        + Adapt and learn from the attacks to patch and cover known vulnerabilities
    </p>
    <p><strong>Zero Trust Architecture:(?)</strong><br>
        + Does not trust any entity, wheter outside or inside network<br>
        + Reduces the risk of attacks and suspicious activities<br>
        + Access is obtained only through strict identification and contextual factors<br>
        + Model is hard to manage and easily confusing, planning is required to use the model to its full potential
    </p>
    <p><strong>Quantum Computing:</strong><br>
        + Poses risk to information security<br>
        + Organizations need to consider these attacks and invest in new cryptographic 
          securities to protect themselves in the long-term
    </p>
    <p><strong>Cybersecurity for IOT:</strong><br>
        + Expanding surface of connected devices bring growing weak points <br>
        + Weak security measures<br>
        + Combat weak points by isolating IOT devices from important systems
    </p>
    <p><strong>Regulations and Compliance:</strong><br>
        + Data regulations become more strict<br>
        + Organizations need to invest and focus complying with these regulations<br>
        + Pressure and penalties will be given should companies fail to abide by the 
          standard
    </p>
    <p><strong>Human Factor and Social Engineering:</strong><br>
        + Conduct programmes to increase security awareness among employees<br>
        + Invest in and use detection systems to find and prevent any social engineering 
          attacks       
    </p>
    <p><strong>Blockchain for Security:</strong><br>
        + Difficult to cover tamper-evident tracks<br>
        + Used for safer identity management
    </p>
